# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the refactoring requirements for the Andrew Portfolio project to improve code quality, maintainability, and adherence to industry standards. The current codebase has several areas that need improvement including component organization, type safety, data management, performance optimization, and code consistency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this codebase, I want improved component organization and structure, so that the code is easier to navigate and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are organized THEN they SHALL be grouped by feature/domain rather than by type
2. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming conventions and file structure
3. WHEN shared components are used THEN they SHALL be properly abstracted and reusable
4. WHEN component files are examined THEN they SHALL have clear separation of concerns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with this codebase, I want improved type safety and TypeScript usage, so that I can catch errors early and have better development experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript interfaces are defined THEN they SHALL be properly typed and exported from dedicated type files
2. WHEN components receive props THEN they SHALL have explicit TypeScript interfaces
3. WHEN data structures are used THEN they SHALL have proper type definitions
4. WHEN API responses are handled THEN they SHALL have typed interfaces

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application state, I want improved data management and constants organization, so that data is centralized and easily maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static data is used THEN it SHALL be moved to dedicated constants files
2. WHEN configuration values are needed THEN they SHALL be centralized in config files
3. WHEN data structures are repeated THEN they SHALL be abstracted into reusable models
4. WHEN hardcoded values exist THEN they SHALL be replaced with named constants

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the portfolio website, I want improved performance and accessibility, so that the site loads quickly and is accessible to all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are loaded THEN they SHALL be optimized and use proper loading strategies
2. WHEN components render THEN they SHALL use React best practices for performance
3. WHEN the site is accessed THEN it SHALL meet WCAG accessibility guidelines
4. WHEN animations are used THEN they SHALL respect user preferences for reduced motion

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working on this project, I want consistent code style and better error handling, so that the codebase is maintainable and robust.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow consistent formatting and naming conventions
2. WHEN errors can occur THEN they SHALL be properly handled with appropriate fallbacks
3. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL include proper error boundaries where needed
4. WHEN async operations are performed THEN they SHALL have proper error handling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer extending this codebase, I want improved component composition and reusability, so that new features can be built efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI patterns are repeated THEN they SHALL be abstracted into reusable components
2. WHEN components are composed THEN they SHALL follow composition over inheritance principles
3. WHEN styling is applied THEN it SHALL use consistent design tokens and utility classes
4. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL be designed for reusability and extensibility

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer deploying this application, I want improved build optimization and code splitting, so that the application performs well in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL use proper code splitting strategies
2. WHEN dependencies are imported THEN they SHALL be optimized to reduce bundle size
3. WHEN static assets are used THEN they SHALL be properly optimized and cached
4. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL have optimal loading performance metrics
